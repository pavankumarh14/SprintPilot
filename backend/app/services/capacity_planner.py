SprintPilot — Capacity-Aware Sprint Planner
============================================
TASK  ★★★

Replace the hardcoded PROPOSED_SPRINT seed data with a dynamic bin-packing
scheduler that respects dependency ordering and per-member capacity.

Problem
-------
The hardcoded sprint plan is static. A real planner must:
  1. Topologically sort the backlog so no ticket is scheduled before its blockers.
  2. Assign each ticket to the best-fit team member within their capacity budget.
  3. Pack as many points as possible without exceeding total available hours.
  4. Defer any ticket that cannot fit, with an explanatory note.

Algorithm
---------
  Topological sort (Kahn's) → Greedy assignment (role-match + capacity-first)
  → Return dict matching PROPOSED_SPRINT shape.

Role → label heuristic
-----------------------
  Backend Engineer   → labels contain "backend"
  Frontend Engineer  → labels contain "frontend"
  AI / ML Engineer   → labels contain "ai"
  QA Engineer        → labels contain "qa" or ticket status is "review"
  Full-stack Engineer→ anything else (catch-all)

API reference
-------------
  app.data.seed_data.TEAM_MEMBERS      — id, name, role, capacity_hours
  app.data.seed_data.LLM_ESTIMATES     — ticket_id → {points, low, high}
  app.data.seed_data.DEPENDENCY_EDGES  — {from, to} DAG edges
  HOURS_PER_POINT = 8.0  (assumed constant throughout this module)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TODO 1 — topological_sort()
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Return ticket IDs in topological order (all blockers before their dependents).
#
# Parameters:
#   ticket_ids : list[str]
#   edges      : list[dict]  — each dict has "from" (blocker) and "to" (blocked)
#
# Algorithm — Kahn's BFS:
#   a. Build adjacency list  adj[u]  = [v, ...]  (u blocks v)
#      and in-degree count   indeg[v] = number of tickets blocking v
#   b. Initialise queue with all nodes where indeg == 0.
#   c. While queue is not empty:
#        pop u → append to result
#        for each v in adj[u]: indeg[v] -= 1; if 0 → enqueue
#   d. If len(result) < len(ticket_ids) a cycle was detected:
#        append remaining nodes (those with indeg > 0) in arbitrary order.
#        Log a warning — never raise.
#   e. Return result.
#
# Acceptance:
#   - len(result) == len(ticket_ids)
#   - Every ticket_id appears exactly once.
#   - For every edge (u, v), u appears before v in result (when no cycle).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TODO 2 — role_score()
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Score how well a member's role matches a ticket's labels (higher is better).
#
# Parameters:
#   member_role   : str        — e.g. "Backend Engineer"
#   ticket_labels : list[str]  — e.g. ["backend", "security"]
#
# Steps:
#   a. Look up the preferred labels for member_role in ROLE_LABEL_MAP.
#   b. Count how many ticket_labels appear in the preferred list.
#   c. Return the count as an int (0 means no preference match).
#
# Acceptance: returns 0 for Full-stack Engineer (catch-all) unless labels
# happen to match; deterministic for the same inputs.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TODO 3 — assign_to_member()
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Choose the best available team member for a single ticket.
#
# Parameters:
#   ticket       : dict   — backlog ticket with "id" and "labels"
#   estimates    : dict   — LLM_ESTIMATES: ticket_id → {points, …}
#   members      : list   — TEAM_MEMBERS list
#   used_hours   : dict   — {member_id: float} hours already committed
#
# Steps:
#   a. Look up points = estimates[ticket["id"]]["points"].
#      hours_needed = points * HOURS_PER_POINT
#   b. Filter members to those where:
#        members[i]["capacity_hours"] - used_hours.get(id, 0) >= hours_needed
#   c. Among eligible members, sort by:
#        1. role_score() descending (best role match first)
#        2. remaining capacity descending (most available first) as tiebreak
#   d. Return the first eligible member's id, or None if no one can take it.
#
# Acceptance: returns a valid member id or None; never raises.

#   e. Build deferred notes string listing ticket IDs and reason (dependency or size).
